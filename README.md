# liquid
C++ tensor algebra &amp; compiler

Liquid is a work in progress, and currently it's not functional.

# principles
- no class hierarchies, keywork 'virtual' is forbidden
- write as few code as possible
- tests are part of documentation
- low-level code is in C++,  high-level code is in miu6
